#   Description of the input and output parameters of the  
#   InitErgmTerm.xxx function, where xxx is the name of your term
#  ------------------------------------------------------------------ 
#
#  INPUTS:
#  Each InitErgmTerm function takes three arguments:
#    		nw: The network of interest
#      arglist: The list of arguments passed to the term xxx
#         ... : There may be other arguments passed by 
#               ergm.getmodel, so each InitErgmTerm function 
#               must include the ... argument
#  These inputs are automatically supplied by ergm.getmodel.
#
#  OUTPUTS:
#  Each InitErgmTerm function should return a list.  
#     REQUIRED LIST ITEMS:
#          name: This names the C changestats function for term xxx, 
#                but does so by excluding the d_ prefix. The 
#                changestats function is named d_xxxy and 'name' is
#                consequently "xxxy". For example, the b1starmix
#                term has 2 changestats functions based on
#                whether the homophily argument is set. These are
#                d_b1starmix and d_b1starmixhomophily. The 'name' 
#                returned by InitErgmTerm.b1starmix is then one of 
#                "b1starmix" or "b1starmixhomophily" as appropriate.
#    coef.names: Vector of names for the coefficients (parameters)
#                as they will be reported in the output.
#       pkgname: This names the package containing the C changestats
#                function d_[name]. The default is "ergm", which means
#                that if you have code that exists as part of the 
#                (say) "ergm.userterms" package, you MUST specify 
#                pkgname="ergm.userterms"
#
#    OPTIONAL LIST ITEMS:
#        inputs: Vector of (double-precision numeric) inputs that the 
#                changestat function called d_'name' may require.
#                The default is NULL; no inputs are required.  But it
#                MUST be a vector!  Thus, if some of the inputs are,  
#                say, matrices, they must be "flattened" to vectors; if 
#                some are categorical character-valued variables, they
#                must be converted to numbers. Optionally, the inputs 
#                vector may have an attribute named "ParamsBeforeCov",
#                which is the number of input parameters preceding the 
#                covariate vector in 'inputs'.  This is necessary for 
#                compatibility with some of the existing d_xxx changestats 
#                functions in ergm, but is not necessary in general.
#    dependence: Logical variable telling whether addition of this term to
#                the model makes the model into a dyadic dependence model.
#                If none of the terms sets dependence==TRUE, then the model
#                is assumed to be a dyadic independence model, which means
#                that the pseudolikelihood estimate coincides with the
#                maximum likelihood estimate.  The default value is TRUE.
#  emptynwstats: Vector of values (if nonzero) for the statistics evaluated
#                on the empty network.  If all are zero for this term, this
#                argument may be omitted.  For example, the degree0 term 
#                would require 'emptynwstats' since degree0 = number of 
#                nodes for the empty network.
#        params: For curved exponential family model terms only, a list of 
#                (numeric) initial values for the parameters of  
#                curved exponential family model terms. Each item in the  
#                list should be named with the corresponding parameter name 
#                (one or more of these will probably coincide with the 
#                 coef.names).  For example, the gwesp term returns 
#                params=list(gwesp=NULL,gwesp.alpha=alpha), where alpha
#                was specified as an argument to the gwesp term. 
#           map: For curved exponential family model terms only, a function 
#                giving the map from the canonical parameters, theta,
#                associated with the statistics for this term, to eta, 
#                the corresponding curved parameters.  The length of eta 
#                is the same as the length of the 'params' list above.
#                The function takes two arguments:  theta and length(eta).
#      gradient: For curved exponential family model terms only, a function 
#                giving the gradient of the 'map'. If theta has length p 
#                and eta has length q, then gradient should return a
#                p by q matrix. This function takes two arguments:  theta 
#                and length(eta).
#


#  ------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
#   Description of the input parameters to the d_xxxy changestats function, 
#   where xxxy corresponds to the 'name' returned by InitErgmTerm.xxx.
#  -------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
#
#  INPUTS:
#  Each d_xxxy function takes five arguments:
#	    ntoggles: the number of toggles as described in 
#                 "ergm.userterms: A template package"
#          heads: a pointer to the array of the head nodes of the 
#                 proposed edges to be toggled
#          tails: a pointer to the array of the tail nodes of the
#                 proposed edges to be toggled
#            mtp: a pointer to the model, which includes the following:
#                 dstats      : a pointer to the array of changestats,
#                               macro-ed as CHANGE_STAT
#                 nstats      : the length of 'dstats', macro-ed as
#                               N_CHANGE_STATS
#                 inputparams : a pointer to the vector of input 
#                               parameters. This is supplied by the
#                               'inputs' returned by InitErgmTerm.xxx
#                               and is macro-ed as INPUT_PARAM
#                 ninputparams: the length of 'inputparams', macro-ed
#                               as N_INPUT_PARAMS
#            nwp: a pointer to the network.  This includes several 
#                 components and several macros exist for accessing
#                 these. See the changestat.h file for a list of these
#                 components and their macros. 
#  These inputs are automatically supplied to the d_xxxy function by the 
#  network_stats_wrapper function
